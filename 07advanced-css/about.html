<h2>Autumn Maria Lani</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Born and raised in Utah.</li>
    <li>With an education in visual design and color theory, she began as a self-taught artist in 2016.</li>
    <li>Autumn comes from a large family of 10 siblings, all which start with the letter A. Each sibling given two middle names in addition to their first name. Maria was taken from Autumn's mother's best friend. Lani is Hawaiian for "Heaven" which (fittingly) comes from Autumn's grandmother. She named her brand Autumn Lani based on her appreciation of her identity and in remberence of her late father and late grandmother. Autumn's art is intended to be accessible to everyone, her work is most meaningful when in a new nursery, a living room full of people, an office welcoming everyone at first site, and anywhere it can be loved, appreciated and admired.</li>
